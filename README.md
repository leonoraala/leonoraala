Weather Predicting Model.

My project is to predict the weather temperature for any month of the year, in my case I chose July. 
  With the basic weather app on my phone, I find that it is not the most accurate; when it says it will rain it does not, cloudy when it says sunny, the temperature is always changing, etc.
  My goal is to find what the average temperature of July this year will be based on 5 yearsâ€™ worth of data.
